Creating a fully functional e-commerce website with React, complete with product listing, cart management, and checkout. 

Step 1: Set Up Your Project

Start by creating a new React project using Create React App or your preferred React boilerplate. Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
Step 2: Create the Project Structure

Define your project structure.
Step 3: Create Mock Data

In your data/products.js file, define mock data for your products:
Step 4: Implement Product Listing

In your ProductList.js component, fetch the product data and display it with filters and "Add to Cart" buttons:
Step 5: Implement Shopping Cart

Create a Cart.js component to manage the shopping cart:
Step 6: Implement Checkout

Create a Checkout.js component for the checkout process:
Step 7: Implement Routing

Use React Router to create routes for product listing, cart, and checkout.

Step 8: Styling and UI Libraries

You can use third-party UI libraries like Material-UI, Chakra UI, or Tailwind CSS for styling your components. Install your chosen library and use its components to build the UI.

Step 9: State Management

For state management, you may consider using React's built-in useState and useContext, or you can opt for more advanced solutions like Redux or Mobx.

Step 10: Responsive Design

Use CSS media queries and responsive design principles to ensure your website works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
